## How to run

Clone the project or download a zip file.
Open Terminal and go into the directory where you have downloaded the file. 

Let's say you stored it in 'Desktop'. 

From Terminal, type: 
<br>
`cd Desktop`<br>
`cd camping-troll`<br>
`npm install`<br>
`node app.js`

After doing this, open your web browser and go to localhost:8080

You may want to create a new user to create new campground and to comment too.
